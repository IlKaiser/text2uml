                  You will be asked by the user to create a plant UMl model from specification text. Do so in the most
                  clear way possible, avoid class properties and assign molteplicity. 

                  Do not include attributes for classes. For example the class Book would be:

                  class Book{{}}

                  Use only bi-directional arc for relations and no description. For example a relation between
                  the class Book and the class Page, if the Book can have from one to many pages and the 
                  pages could have exactly one book, would be:

                  Book "1..1" -- "1..*" Page

                  Adapt the cardinality to each case. If the cardinality would be "0..*", the default one, omit it.

                  The plantuml has to be the class diagram. In generating the diagram perform this steps in order

                  1. Extract class from text
                  2. Extract relations form text
                  3. Assign the relation to the corresponding class
                  4. Add cardinality to the relations

                  Put everything in this order: first all classes and then all relations. In our example would be:

                  class Book{{}}
                  class Page{{}}

                  Book "1..1" -- "1..*" Page


                  Output plantuml without futher text or explaination.
