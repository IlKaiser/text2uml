The company possesses a number of trajectories which have to be approved by town authorities.  When the company asks for approval, that approval may be refused without appeal or town authorities may ask the bus company to change the trajectory upon which the company may ask again for approval.  This procedure may be repeated a number of times.  When approval is given, the trajectory is included in the business of the company to become operational at the beginning of the next calendar year.  From that time on, busses can be assigned to the trajectory.  The trajectory may be suspended for some time for all kinds of reasons.  At a certain moment in time, the trajectory is cancelled.   Buses get a 'line' number. A 'Line' is mostly the same as a trajectory, but not entirely. For the sake of this case, we assume that a line groups a number of overlapping trajectories. E.g., in the late evening, the last section of a line may be skipped (trajectory is shorter), or there is a bifurcation with two different end points at one end, which are taken alternatively. E.g. in Leuven, one has \"Line 2 Campus\" and \"Line 2 Boskant\" which follow partly the same and partly different routes. Bus company \"De Lijn\" wishes to test a new type of season ticket, called MENSO.  For the purpose of the MENSO project, all bus lines have been assigned a category.  A MENSO ticket is valid during one year and the price of a trip depends of the category of line you are travelling with.  As a result, the price of the ticket is not known in advance and MENSO users will be invoiced at the end of each month for the trips of the past month.   In order to pay with a trip with MENSO, the user simply introduces his/her card in the ticket machine next to the bus door upon entering the bus.  The system will then register time, date and line of the trip.  If the user has forgotten his/her menso-card, (s)he has to pay in the usual way: by buying a ticket of using another type of card. The time, date and line information is collected in order to generate the monthly invoices. Depending on the total invoice amount, the customer will be granted a discount of up to 20%.  Invoicing and payment happens in any order: a customer might receive the next invoice before the first one is paid. Through the MENSO system, \"De Lijn\" hopes to gather interesting information on the behaviour of his customers.  When subscribing to MENSO, the customer will be requested some personal data such as home address, office address and working hours.  By combining this information with the information generated by using the MENSO card, De Lijn hopes to detect patterns in travelling habits, allowing to optimise the routes and frequency of the bus lines.

Customers can pay their refuel turn in cash at the counter or with a personal credit card, but they can also ask for a refuel card.  When using their refuel card, customers do not pay the refuel turn immediately. Rather, at the end of each month, the holder of the fuel card receives a monthly invoice with the amounts of all the refuel turns paid with the fuel card.  On the monthly invoice discounts are given depending on the turnover of the customer during the invoiced month.  Invoicing and paying occurs in any order: one can already receive a second invoice before having paid the first one.  But obviously, each invoice must first have been sent before a payment can be received. Each refuel turn only appears on the invoice of the month of the refuel turn. If a customer doesn't pay the invoice, the unpaid refuel turns are not added to the next month’s invoice. Instead, the invoice is simply sent again to the customer to remind him/her of the payment due. If a customer repeatedly does not pay the invoices (e.g. two months in a row), then the customer is suspended and his/her card is blocked until the bills have been paid.  The exact threshold to block a customer is not 100% fixed: very good customers are given a bit more slack than new customers.  If the bills are settled, a customer may return to the normal state.

The system should produce a daily report indicating which pump needs to be refilled and for each pump the current level of gasoline and the quantity to order. As the bottom of a tank can contain dirt, when the fuel drops below a critical level, the pump is automatically blocked so that no refueling can occur with this pump. For the same reason, when refilling a tank that was still above the critical level, the pump is temporarily blocked by the gas station responsible for approximatively an hour, so that dirt can sink to the bottom.

Suppose John stays in a service flat but breaks his leg and therefore has to stay in rest&nursing for a while. His stay in the service flat will then be suspended but not ended. The switch to rest&nursing doesn't require a proposal either as John is already an inhabitant.  People wishing to reside in the home go through a registration process.  This registration process involves answering a set of questions concerning the person's basic identification data. As a final step, the data of the person is registered in the system. Once the basic registration is done, the abilities of a person are assessed by means of questions that gauge the person's needs for help for basic activities such as eating, dressing, personal care (like taking a shower), as this will give an indication of the type of stay best suited for that person. The assessment results in a type of stay defined for the person. As soon as a person has been assessed, the person is considered to be on the waiting list for the corresponding type of stay. The position on the waiting list is determined by the registration date only. When a bed of the corresponding category is free, it is proposed to the person that is on the highest position of the waiting list. The person needs then to inform the Rest & Nursing Home within three days about whether s/he accepts or refuses the proposal. If the proposal is refused, the person stays on the waiting list and a new proposal is made to the next person on the list who requested this type of stay, ... and so on until a person accepts the proposal.  Once a proposal is accepted, the person's abilities are re-assessed such as to validate the requested type of stay. After this validation, the date of intake is determined and the effective stay will start on that day.  In case the type of stay needs to be changed after the re-assessment, the proposal is marked as invalidated, and the requested type of stay is updated, but the person remains in the same position on the waiting list.  Stays are invoiced once a month. For the sake of simplicity, payments will not be treated as objects, but as events. When a payment is received, this is registered and the outstanding amount of the invoice is reduced with the amount paid.  If the remaining amount is zero, the invoice is registered as \"paid\". If the remaining amount is still positive (paid amount too low), then the outstanding amount is adjusted, and the invoice is re-sent, indicating the remaining amount to pay.  If a person pays too much, the following actions are undertaken: the outstanding amount is set to zero, invoice is registered as paid and a credit note is created and the refund is executed immediately.  As long as an invoice is not registered as paid, it can be modified: if the inhabitant or his/her representative complains about the items that have been invoiced, this can be corrected.  When a stay comes to an end (because of the inhabitant's death or because this person decides to move to another place), the invoicing processes will continue until all invoices are paid.  The type of the stay will determine the amount that is invoiced.  In case e.g. a service flat stay goes on while an inhabitant resides in rest & nursing for a while, both stays will be invoiced, but a discount will apply to the service flat stay.    Fig. 1.

As soon as a customer addresses Alpha Insurance, a broker is assigned to follow the customer’s file.

After the broker is assigned to the customer, the latter indicates which type(s) of insurance policy they would like to sign for, so the broker could, depending on the case, either assess the customer’s profile on the spot or send the customer’s file for analysis to the head office. After the customer’s profile has been assessed and the customer has been deemed trustworthy , a preliminary contract/offer on an insurance product is made to the customer either in person or by email. (Such offers can also be extended to already existing customers.) If the customer agrees to the offer, the contract is signed by both parties. After the signing of the contract, the client enjoys the coverage and is invoiced (monthly or yearly – depending on the choice made in the contract) according to the price of the insurance product they bought.  In case the insured event happens, a customer should send a claim for compensation. Then the company opens one or several claim cases (e.g. in case of an accident, often material damage & physical damage are handled separately). Once the case file is complete, it is sent for assessment by different estimators based on their area of expertise. According to the reports issued by the estimators, it is decided whether the claim case is approved. In case of approval the compensation decision is registered that stipulates which costs are eligible for (partial) refund.  For the supplied documents, the sum of compensation is calculated and the compensation is paid to the customer’s account.

First, create an EDG for the use case described in STEP 1, and add attributes, event types, non-default FSMs and constraints if necessary. For each step, revise your model and add, remove or change elments where necessary. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- STEP 1 Your brand new company sells goods to local supermarkets. You want to create a simple information system to keep track of your stock, your customers and their orders.  When you register a new customer, you enter their address and VAT number.  To keep track of your stock, you want to be able to register the products you offer and the current stock of each product. Your customers' orders consist of one or more order lines, with each order line recording the quantity ordered of a particular product.  To minimise the overhead of managing payments and deliveries for your small business, your customers are required to pay for their order in full before it is sent out for delivery. Similarly, orders are always shipped in their entirety to keep shipping simple. To ensure that you have the information you need for your accounts, you want to record when orders are paid for and shipped.  At the end of each working day, you manually adjust the stock levels of your products in the system based on the orders placed that day.  STEP 2  As your business grows, you start to offer more exclusive products that are not always available. To ensure customer satisfaction, you want to start organising deliveries on a line-by-line basis so that available products can be shipped immediately and unavailable products can be shipped later.  Of course, you need to adapt your information system to keep track of partially shipped orders so that you can record which order lines have been shipped and which are still on the to-be-shipped list. Orders that have been fully shipped will also be marked so that you know that they can be removed from your watchlist.  STEP 3  As your products become more popular, you start supplying larger supermarkets. These supermarkets sometimes have several warehouses that they use for different locations. You want to start keeping track of both the customer's head office address and the addresses where the orders are delivered.   To further professionalise your business, you want to send invoices to your customers for their orders. Customers can now choose to pay the invoice directly when they place the order, or after the order has been delivered. An order should still be paid in full.  STEP 4 As your business grows, keeping track of shipments on a line-by-line basis becomes too cumbersome. You would prefer to do this for each group of order lines that are shipped together.   In addition, you have recently noticed some problems with the delivery service you use, as customers have informed you that some deliveries are missing or damaged. You want to gather more information about the deliveries in order to decide whether you should switch to another delivery service or start delivering yourself. To do this, you want to know the status of each delivery (remember that partial deliveries of one or more order lines are possible). You want to track a shipment as it is packed, shipped and received by the customer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "@startuml  class Product{} class Customer{} class OrderLine{} class InvoiceLine{} class Order{} class Invoice{} class DeliveryLine{} class Delivery{}  Product \"1\" -- \"0..*\" OrderLine Customer \"1\" -- \"0..*\" Order OrderLine \"0..*\" -- \"1\" Order InvoiceLine \"0..1\" -- \"1..1\" OrderLine InvoiceLine \"0..*\" -- \"1\" Invoice Order \"1\" -- \"0..1\" Invoice DeliveryLine \"0..1\" -- \"1\" OrderLine DeliveryLine \"0..*\" -- \"1\" Delivery Order \"1\" -- \"0..*\" Delivery   @enduml"}]}

They have fully automated stations that function without on-site staff.  Using modern mobile application customers can conveniently rent electric scooters from any station. Each customer has the flexibility to rent multiple scooters simultaneously, allowing for family or group outings. Rental prices are determined based on the ride duration, with customers having the freedom to ride as long as they wish before returning the scooter to any station in the network. Payment occurs at the end of the month through a detailed monthly invoice. Customers risk being blocked after three consecutive unpaid invoices and may be unblocked upon settling all outstanding payments. While CityRide possesses a fleet of scooters, not all of those scooters are always available for rent. Some scooters undergo maintenance or await deployment at the company's warehouse. When a customer reserves a scooter through the app, it is exclusively reserved for them, and they can easily pick it up from the station and use it for as long as they wish. After use, customers must return the scooter to the station, park it in any available dedicated parking spot, and terminate the ride through the app. Only once the ride is terminated, does the scooter become available for the next customer. In the event of a breakdown during use, customers can contact the company, and a representative will promptly retrieve the scooter for maintenance.

As aircrafts are very expensive to build, they are only built \"on demand\", meaning that first a sales agreement is made with a customer, before the airplane is actually built.

The sales are regulated by means of contracts with the airline companies, whereby a single contract may consist of several acquisitions of airplanes. The global contract stipulates common elements across all acquisitions such as delivery conditions, legal aspects, etc. Each acquisition of an airplane has further specific details, such as the negotiated price for that airplane, chosen options, delivery date, etc. Each contract is managed by a Boeing salesperson. An employee can act as salesperson for several contracts. Given the long term of contracts, the assigned salesperson may change over time, but Boeing ensures there is always a salesperson available for the client.  Some airlines are related to each other: for example, main airlines often have a low cost daughter airline company. Such related airlines often share airplanes or sell their airplanes to their partners. As Boeing has different discount policies per airline, Boeing would like to avoid selling aircrafts at a high discount to one airline company, and then see this aircraft ending up at a partner airline that cannot benefit from the same large discount. Boeing therefore keep track as much as possible of the mother-daughter relationships between airline companies, to be able to track whether to sold aircrafts are shifted to partner airlines of the original buyer.

Patients are assigned one or more doctors, which try to make a diagnosis for the sick patient. For each illness HospitalHouseMD has a database with all possible treatments. These treatments can be applied to any diagnosis and are accordingly executed. To keep everything under control, the head doctor has to approve the diagnosis made by another doctor before any treatment can happen.  A treatment can go through three stages.  The first stage is the weakest treatment. In this stage, no consent is necessary by the patient, and treatment can start immediately. When this doesn’t work, treatment needs to move to stage 2 or even directly to stage 3, according to the rules described below. To move the treatment from stage 1 to another stage, consent is needed by the patient. The patient needs to sign a form indicating his/her consent to move his/her treatments to a higher stage. Once this consent has been given, any applied treatment for that patient can be moved to a higher stage, without the need to ask consent again. So, once a consent is signed by the patient, all treatments can freely upgrade from stage 1 to 2 and 3, until the patient retracts his/her consent. Patients with a treatment in stage 3 require a higher follow-up rate and will be checked more often by nurses and doctors. Once the higher follow-up rate isn’t needed anymore for a specific treatment for a patient, the treatment can downgrade again to lower stages (downgrading is the responsibility of the doctor).  Illnesses also get a priority score, this is necessary to prevent any outbreaks from e.g. unknown viruses. The priority score of an illness can change at any given time. For now HospitalHouseMD only has two priority scores: high and low. When an illness gets priority score high, all applied treatments for that illness are immediately placed into stage 3, by means of a priority stage upgrade. No consent of the patients are needed to move the treatment to stage 3 when the priority score of the illness is high.
