After the broker is assigned to the customer, the latter indicates which type(s) of insurance policy they would like to sign for, so the broker could, depending on the case, either assess the customer’s profile on the spot or send the customer’s file for analysis to the head office. After the customer’s profile has been assessed and the customer has been deemed trustworthy , a preliminary contract/offer on an insurance product is made to the customer either in person or by email. (Such offers can also be extended to already existing customers.) If the customer agrees to the offer, the contract is signed by both parties. After the signing of the contract, the client enjoys the coverage and is invoiced (monthly or yearly – depending on the choice made in the contract) according to the price of the insurance product they bought.\n",

According to the reports issued by the estimators, it is decided whether the claim case is approved. In case of approval the compensation decision is registered that stipulates which costs are eligible for (partial) refund.  For the supplied documents, the sum of compensation is calculated and the compensation is paid to the customer’s account.
