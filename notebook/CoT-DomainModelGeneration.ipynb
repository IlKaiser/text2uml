After the customerâ€™s profile has been assessed and the customer has been deemed trustworthy , a preliminary contract/offer on an insurance product is made to the customer either in person or by email. (Such offers can also be extended to already existing customers.) If the customer agrees to the offer, the contract is signed by both parties.
