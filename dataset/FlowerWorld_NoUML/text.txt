If you like to have fresh flowers every week in your house, or have new plants now and then, FlowerWorld has an interesting offer for you. FlowerWorld offers subscriptions for a weekly or monthly delivery of plants and cut flowers at your house or office. Different types of subscription exist: only flowers, only plants, seasonal flowers only, seasonal mixed flower and plants, etc. It is possible to see what kind of bouquets or plants are part of a subscription: in the catalogue you can see the individual types of bouquets and plants, as well as which of them is part of what subscription type. When subscribing, you choose the subscription type you'd like to have, as well as the frequency of delivery (weekly or monthly), the start date and the number of deliveries.  Of course, it is possible to offer a subscription to someone else.  So the delivery address needs not to be the address of the invoiced person.  Besides subscribing for a regular delivery, it is also possible to place an order for a one-time delivery, e.g. for a special occasion like an anniversary birthday, etc.

When a bouquet or plant is prepared for delivery to a customer, this should be a bouquet or plant that is part of the subscription type of customer has subscribed to (e.g. if you chose for monthly plant delivery, you should not be delivered a bouquet of cut flowers).
