The EDP-department of a large company consists of several groups. Each employee is assigned to exactly one group. Each development project has one group responsible for it. People from different groups can be assigned full-time or part-time to the same project. One person can be assigned to more than one project simultaneously. In order to keep track of the development cost of information systems, each member of the development staff has to register the number of hours (s)he worked for a particular project. A person can only register working hours for projects (s)he is assigned to. When a project comes to an end, all assignments are closed as well. Finished projects and closed assignments can be kept for a while for cost analysis purposes.
