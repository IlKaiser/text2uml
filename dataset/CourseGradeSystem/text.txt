The course-marks system enables lecturers to enter student marks for a pre-defined set of courses and students enrolled on those courses. Since students can retake exams, multiple marks can be inputted by the lecturer (one for each exam attempt). For each exam attempt, marks can be updated by lecturers, but the lecturers cannot change the basic course information, as the course lists are the responsibility of the system administrator. The system is menu-driven, with the lecturer selecting from a choice of courses and then a choice of operations. The operations are:

enter coursework marks (per course)
enter exam marks (per exam attempt)
compute averages
produce grades letters
display information on the screen
print information to a printer

The information that is displayed/printed is a list of students together with all the known marks, grades and averages.
