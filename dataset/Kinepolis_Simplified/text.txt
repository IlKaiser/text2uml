Kinepolis owns several cinemas in different towns.  Each cinema has several theatres in which several shows can be programmed per day.  Every cinema needs its own copy of the movie, and possibly more than one if a movie is to be played simultaneously in more than one theatre.  A copy will only be shown in the theatres of the premise where the copy is located. But copies of movies can be moved to another cinema if required by the programming.  
The planning of the shows is made and registered in the system long in advance, but is not visible to the public. Every Sunday, the program for the next week is published for the next week (from Wednesday to Tuesday). 
Seat tickets can be bought at the entrance of the theater. Each ticket is assigned a seat number.  At the ticketing desk a display shows which seats are still available for that show (see picture).
Tickets issued at the entrance are anonymous and cannot be cancelled or refunded. A published show can be cancelled by Kinepolis as long as there are no sold tickets for that show.
