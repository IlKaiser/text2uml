In a company, customers can place orders. Each order can be for any number of products, with each product within an order forming an order line.  The customer can change the order several times or even cancel it.  Changing an order means changing the quantity for one or more order lines, or cancelling one or more order lines, or adding one or more order lines.  A delivery delivers a number of order lines belonging to one or more orders from the same customer.  However, it is not necessary that the entire quantity of the order line is delivered at the same time: partial deliveries are allowed.  
A delivery is a package that is put together by determining which items are to be included or excluded and immediately picking these items. Once picking is complete, the parcel is 'finalised' by adding the picking slip and sealing the parcel. It is then ready for shipping. When the parcel is received by the customer, their signature is recorded. To prevent endless order changes, an order line can only be changed or cancelled until the first delivery for that order line has started. 
Invoices are sent monthly for the previous month's deliveries. An invoice may include partially or fully delivered order lines from different orders. Once the invoice has been sent to the customer, it cannot be changed.
If the company wants to sell a product, it must first be approved by the board of directors. Once approved, the company can put the product up for sale. It should also be possible to remove the on sale status from a product. Of course, a product can only be ordered when it is on sale.
