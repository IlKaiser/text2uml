Rent-an-orchid is a company that rents orchids for permanent placement in other companies or for temporary placement on events (weddings, receptions, …). Before an orchid can be placed at a company or an event, the placement of the orchid should be reserved first. Only one reservation is possible at any given time per orchid. After the reservation, the orchid can be shipped to location, or the placement can be cancelled. Once the orchid is on location, the placement can’t be cancelled anymore. When the placement ends, the orchids are brought back to Rent-an-orchid, where they are kept in the greenhouse (or central warehouse).  In this place Rent-an-Orchid keeps and nurses all the orchids who are not on location. Because Rent-an-orchid only wants the best for its customers, the company only rents out orchids which flourish (which have flowers). An orchid which doesn’t have flowers can’t be reserved (or put on location) and is kept in the greenhouse until it flourishes again. Caretakers nurse the orchids that have been reserved or placed. When a caretaker notices that an orchid on location has lost its flowers, the caretaker will bring the orchid back to the greenhouse, a new placement will then be reserved for another orchid.
