A bus company has a number of buses which are used for regular-line services and also for special purposes, such as school trips.  Buses can switch between the two types of uses but cannot be used at the same time for line services and for special purposes.  For the line service, the company possesses a number of trajectories which have to be approved by town authorities.  When the company asks for approval, that approval may be refused without appeal or town authorities may ask the bus company to change the trajectory upon which the company may ask again for approval.  This procedure may be repeated a number of times.  When approval is given, the trajectory is included in the business of the company to become operational at the beginning of the next calendar year.  From that time on, busses can be assigned to the trajectory.  The trajectory may be suspended for some time for all kinds of reasons.  At a certain moment in time, the trajectory is cancelled.
