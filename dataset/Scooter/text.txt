CityRide operates as an electric scooter rental company which provides scooters for short-term rent. They have fully automated stations that function without on-site staff. 
Using modern mobile application customers can conveniently rent electric scooters from any station. Each customer has the flexibility to rent multiple scooters simultaneously, allowing for family or group outings. Rental prices are determined based on the ride duration, with customers having the freedom to ride as long as they wish before returning the scooter to any station in the network. Payment occurs at the end of the month through a detailed monthly invoice. Customers risk being blocked after three consecutive unpaid invoices and may be unblocked upon settling all outstanding payments.
While CityRide possesses a fleet of scooters, not all of those scooters are always available for rent. Some scooters undergo maintenance or await deployment at the company's warehouse. When a customer reserves a scooter through the app, it is exclusively reserved for them, and they can easily pick it up from the station and use it for as long as they wish. After use, customers must return the scooter to the station, park it in any available dedicated parking spot, and terminate the ride through the app. Only once the ride is terminated, does the scooter become available for the next customer. In the event of a breakdown during use, customers can contact the company, and a representative will promptly retrieve the scooter for maintenance.
