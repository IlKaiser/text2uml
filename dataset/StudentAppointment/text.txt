Students can ask questions about the courses they are following by making an appointment with the teaching assistants of these respective courses. To be able to manage the high demand for appointments with the teaching assistants, a system is made to keep track of every appointment of a teaching assistant and a student(s). A student can only request an appointment for a particular course when (s)he is also registered for the respective course. A teaching assistant can also only provide help for the courses (s)he is teaching. An appointment is always for only one specific course, and with one particular assistant who is TA (teaching assistant) for that course.
