Donation Bank is a non-profit organization that collects gifts from private persons. Collected gifts need to be certified for tax deduction purposes. Donation Bank has a number of  projects, and gifts can be donated to projects. The only prerequisite is that the sum of the amounts of the donations for a project doesnâ€™t exceed the project budget (which is fixed when a project is defined, but can be changed afterwards). 
When a person donates money, (s)he can attribute the gift to a particular project.  Non-attributed gifts of the past year are attributed by the Donation Bank Council to one or more projects by the end of January.
When a gift is attributed to a project, an acknowledgement is sent to the person. Donation acknowledgements should happen only once.
During the month May, each person receives a certificate for the total amount of gifts of the past  fiscal year. Each gift is certified at most once.
Persons, gifts and projects are archived as appropriate for a duration of 15 years.  After that the information can be deleted.
