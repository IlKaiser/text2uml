In a company, customers can place orders. Each order can be for any number of products, with each product within an order forming an order line.  The customer can change the order several times or even cancel it.  Changing an order means changing the quantity for one or more order lines, or cancelling one or more order lines, or adding one or more order lines.  A delivery delivers a number of order lines belonging to one or more orders from the same customer.  However, it is not necessary that the entire quantity of the order line is delivered at the same time: partial deliveries are allowed.  An order line can be changed or cancelled as long as the first delivery for that order line has not been made.  Invoices are sent monthly for the previous month's deliveries. An invoice may include partially or fully delivered order lines from different orders.
Optional addition
When the stock of a product falls below a pre-defined level, the company places a back-order with the supplier of the product. The management of back-orders placed by the company with suppliers is similar to the management of customer orders.
